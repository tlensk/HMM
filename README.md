# HMM toolkit 

## Tatiana Lenskaia (t.lenskaia@utoronto.ca)

This repository contains a suite of scripts designed for manipulating Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Key features include tools for HMM annotation, validation, and application to genomic sequences, along with utilities for visualizing results and integrating with existing bioinformatics pipelines. By streamlining the HMM annotation process, this repository aids researchers in accurately identifying protein-coding regions, thus enhancing the quality and depth of phage genomic studies.
