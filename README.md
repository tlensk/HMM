#### Abstract
<p align="left">The staggering diversity of bacteriophages seems to exceed human comprehension and defy systematic understanding. In this study, we focus on the non-contractile tail tips of phages that infect Proteobacteria, a group of phages notable for both their ecological significance and their sequence variability. Yet, by focusing on this specific group of phages, we uncover patterns that bring clarity to this apparent complexity. Despite substantial divergence in tail tip protein sequences, our analysis reveals recurring organizational features that simplify their interpretation and highlight underlying functional determinants. This demonstrates that even in highly variable regions of phage genomes, systematic understanding is within reach. We further suggest that this perspective extends beyond tail tips, providing a framework for studying phage proteins at large. By narrowing the scope to carefully defined structural components, the seemingly limitless complexity of bacteriophages becomes progressively more approachable, bringing us closer to understanding of the basis for their diversity and evolutionary success.</p>
